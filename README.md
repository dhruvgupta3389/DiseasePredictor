# DiseasePredictor

**DiseasePredictor** is a Python-based application that predicts diseases based on input symptoms and provides medication recommendations. It uses machine learning techniques, specifically a decision tree classifier, to predict diseases from a set of common symptoms. The model also recommends appropriate medications for the predicted disease.

## Features

- **Symptom-based Disease Prediction**: Input symptoms are used to predict a possible disease.
- **Medication Recommendations**: Based on the predicted disease, the application provides general medication recommendations.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: The tool uses a straightforward CLI, where users input their symptoms, and it outputs the predicted disease and recommended medications.

## Supported Diseases

- **Common Cold**
- **Influenza**
- **Allergy**
- **COVID-19**

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **scikit-learn** (For the Decision Tree Classifier)
- **NumPy** (For data manipulation)
- **MultiLabelBinarizer** (For encoding symptoms)

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x.
